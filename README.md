# Eos

**A global discord AI-powered policing bot**

Eos is not just a Discord bot; it's a global force in decentralised moderation and *policing*. With a robust backend database and a sophisticated 3-strike to-ban automated system built around our in-house research and developed neural networks, Eos operates as a mostly passive yet highly effective guardian for your Discord community!

**Decentralized Moderation**:

Eos takes moderation to the next level with a decentralised heavy-hitting approach. As it's spread across a growing number of global communities, Eos ensures that moderation is efficient, responsive and swift as it works to create a secure environment and federation of servers where your safety is paramount.

A strike in one server spreads across them all!

**Backend Database Power**:

Backed by a twin-designed backend dual database Eos boasts the ability to store and process vast amounts of data; enabling quick and precise actions all while remaining encrypted. This ensures that when database sync requests come through we can service them sooner than later and with routine backups of the databases it means we've always got a point of recovery. Ready to protect your servers and communities?

**Dual-approach 3-Strike to Ban Automated System**:

Eos implements a sophisticated 3-strike to ban automated systems. Pre-trained on over 1,700 words and 3,500 phrases, Eos passively scans messages (*without logging them*) and simply deletes any messages that aren't flavourful, if you have a logging bot enabled, only then may the deleted messages get logged. This is the soft element, and the second element is the firm approach to rule enforcement. Utilising the `strike` command administrators on a server can issue a strike against a user which spreads across the global database. This system ensures that repeat offenders are dealt with consistently, maintaining the integrity of the federation of servers under Eos.


As you can tell Eos operates mostly passively, allowing your community to flourish without constant interference. Its intelligent algorithms work in the background, stepping in only when necessary, giving your members the freedom to express themselves within the boundaries Eos has set.

All you need to do is invite it and `sync` when you feel like it! (*though Eos does this itself on-boot it's suggested you do it yourself too*)
