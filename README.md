# Eos

**A global Discord AI-powered reputation system and passive policing bot**

Eos is more than just a Discord bot; it's a global reputation system and a guardian with a subtle policing approach. With a robust dual-designed backend database and an innovative 3-strike system, Eos operates as a mostly passive yet highly effective reputation manager for your Discord community!

**Passive Reputation Management**:

Eos revolutionises moderation by introducing a decentralized and passive reputation management approach. Spread across various global communities, Eos ensures that reputation management is efficient and responsive running in parallel, creating a secure environment is paramount to Eos!

*A strike in the federated network of servers in one server reflects in others in the federated network!*

**Advanced Backend Database**:

Empowered by a dual-designed backend database, Eos can efficiently store and process extensive data, enabling quick and precise actions while maintaining database encryption. Routine backups ensure data integrity, offering a secure foundation to protect your servers and communities.

Strike commands issued will be stored in the federated database, and on a daily basis, all federated users on tag or banned (*users with over 3 strikes*) will be transferred to the un-federated database. Each server retains the autonomy to choose whether it wishes to synchronize with the federated database or the un-federated database. If they choose to sync at all. The bot can be used as nothing more than a reputation and record-checking system if they prefer. Giving each server the power to utilise the bot as they see fit.

**Innovative 3-Strike System**:

Eos employs an advanced 3-strike automated system, pre-trained on a vast array of words and phrases. It passively scans messages (*without logging them*) deletes any content that deviates from acceptable norms and informs the user privately what message was removed and in which server, this in itself **will not strike** a user - striking is a manual action. Additionally, server administrators can issue strikes using the `strike` command, affecting the federated database. This ensures consistent action against repeat offenders, preserving the integrity of the federation of servers under Eos.

Each server can strike a user **once**, this means any user with say 2 or 3 strikes would have been struck in 3 independent servers by an average of 3 independent users this mitigates brute-force striking. Makes brute-force striking attempts apparent in the database, so that we can un-strike a user ourselves on appeal, it also means that a user who ended up having to go through appeals (3+ strikes) must have gotten to that point through unanimous action across 3 independent servers.

*Eos operates mostly passively, allowing your community to thrive without constant interference. Its intelligent algorithms work in the background, intervening only when necessary, giving your members the freedom to express themselves within the set boundaries by Eos.*

All it takes is an invitation and a simple `sync` when needed (although Eos handles this on boot, it's recommended to do it manually).
